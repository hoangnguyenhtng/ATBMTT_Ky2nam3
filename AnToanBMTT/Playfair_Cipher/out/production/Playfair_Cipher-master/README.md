# Playfair_Cipher

This is a repository based on Java, which involves the concept of Playfair Cipher of cryptography. 

This program will help us to encrypt messages of huge sizes into very secure and complicated ciphertext and that too within few seconds, which would have otherwise taken a very very long time if it was for a human to do it, thus also showing us the power of computers.
